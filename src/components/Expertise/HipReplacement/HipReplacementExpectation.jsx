              <b>Pain:</b> After your hip surgery you may be offered a block
              (freezing of the nerves around the hip) to help control your pain
              after surgery. This is optional and will be decided after a
              discussion with the anesthesiologist on the day of your surgery.
              Dr Mutch will inject freezing medications around your hip during
              the surgery and these typically last about 8 hours. You will be
              given Tylenol, anti-inflammatories and stronger medications
              (narcotics) if needed to control your pain. These same medications
              will be prescribed for you at home and you will be able to take
              them as needed for pain control.{" "}

            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Motion:</b> Within a few hours of surgery you will be seen by a
              physiotherapist and you will get up to walk for the first time.
              You will use a walker in the beginning and gradually wean off as
              you become stronger and more confident. By 4 weeks most of Dr
              Mutchâ€™s patients are either walking without any assistance or with
              a cane as needed. Low-impact exercises like stationary cycling are
              encouraged as early as 2 weeks after your surgery.

              <b>Healing:</b> You will have a dressing on the front of your knee
              that will stay in place for 7-10 days. Once removed and the cut is
              seen by the nurse (or pictures sent to Dr Mutch by e-mail) and
              healed nicely, activities in water and the pool are permitted.
              Swelling and stiffness around the knee is normal and will improve
              with ice, time and exercises.
