          <p>
            A hip replacement is an appropriate option when you suffer from
            end-stage (bone on bone) cartilage injury in your hip. This usually
            causes daily pain, stiffness, and limitations in your activities â€“
            such as walking, stairs, putting on your socks and shoes, sports and
            even work. Many conditions can lead to cartilage injury in your hip
            and these include:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>- Osteoarthritis</li>
              <li>- Inflammatory arthritis</li>
              <li>- Avascular necrosis (dead bone)</li>
              <li>- Injury (old or new)</li>
              <li>- Prior surgery</li>
            </ul>
            Before considering surgery it is important to exhaust non-surgical
            options as these are often very effective in reducing your pain and
            improving your function without surgery. These include: <br />
            <ul>
              <li>- Exercise</li>
              <li>- Physical therapy</li>
              <li>- Weight loss</li>
              <li>- Dietary changes</li>
              <li>- Oral medication (Tylenol, anti-inflammatories)</li>
              <li>- Bracing</li>
              <li>
                - Injections (cortisone, hyaluronic acid, PRP - platelet-rich
                plasma)
              </li>
            </ul>
            If you continue to have significant pain and poor function despite
            these treatments then it is time to see your orthopedic surgeon to
            see if a hip replacement is right for you. <br />
