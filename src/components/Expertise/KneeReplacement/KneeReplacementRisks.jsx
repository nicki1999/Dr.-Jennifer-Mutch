          </h6>
          <p>
            Knee replacements are the most common joint replacement performed in
            Canada and around the world. Results are typically excellent in 85%
            of cases or more. However, there are risks of some complications and
            these include: infection, stiffness, loosening, blood clots,
            fracture, injury to an artery or nerve and medical complications.
            These are rare and the risks can change depending on your health.
            These will be discussed in detail during your appointment with Dr
            Mutch.
